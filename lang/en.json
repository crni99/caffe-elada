        "sectionText3": "In Elada, we combined two loves: Greek and our own local one. We love the Greek sea and our hills. Over there, Metaxa; here, Rakija and Valjevsko beer. And in Elada, it all lives together.",
        "sectionText4": "Here you will find a large selection of Greek beers, Rakija, liqueurs, alongside the inevitable ouzo and that warmth that is not served in a glass.",
